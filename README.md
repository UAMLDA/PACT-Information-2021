# About 
This repo is for students participating in the PACT summer research fellowship program. Here you will find software that will be useful for this project and the domain of machine learning. Further, there are many cloud resources that are useful for coding, computing and project management.

# General Software 
* [Anaconda Distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - Recommended distribution of Python to use on your local computer. This is run on Windows, Linux and Mac. Highly recommend! 
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Python module for neural networks 
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Python package for neural networks
* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Great software IDE and debugger
